A function that takes a data frame with cleaned-up PSM output from MODa as input and calculates counts of specific modifications we are interested in.
```{r}
countMethylationsMods <- function(PSM_data)
{
  write_to_log("Counting Methylations mods")

  # Count the total number of unmodified peptides and peptides with any sort of modification
  PSM_data %>% group_by(Base.Peptide) %>%
    summarize( unmod = sum(is.na(Modification)),
               anymod = sum(!is.na(Modification))) -> anymod_counts
 
  # now the specific mods
  Methmod_counts <- PSM_data %>%
                    group_by(Base.Peptide) %>%
                    summarize(
                      # any + 14 modification
                      any_M14 = sum(na.omit(Modification == 14)),
                      
                      # K + 14 modification
                      K_M14 = sum(na.omit(Modification == 14 & Modified.aa == "K")),
                      
                      # R + 14 modification
                      R_M14 = sum(na.omit(Modification == 14 & Modified.aa == "R")),
                      
                      # E + 14 modification
                      E_M14 = sum(na.omit(Modification == 14 & Modified.aa == "E"))
                                                )

  # now combine everything into one table
