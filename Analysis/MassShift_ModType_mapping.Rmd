title: "Inverted hash table for mass-shift modification mapping"
output: html_document
---
Let's use ABRF delta mass table (MassShift_ModficationType.csv) as input and create a key-value for each mass-shift to modificaiton type.
```{r}
require(hash)
```

 Remember a mass-shift can map to many mod types, so here create a hash table (with key as mod-type) and then invert it so that we can look for mod types using mass-shift.
 
```{r}
# Load the table from ABRF delta mass
MS<-read.csv("../Analysis/MassShift_ModificationType.csv",sep="\t", header = TRUE, row.names = NULL)
#assign the name of mod as key
key<-MS[,2]
# assign the mass-shift as value
value<-MS[,1]
# create a hash table with mass-shifts as values and mod types as keys
h<-hash(key,value)
# invert it, as the final goal is to get the mod type from the mass-shift outputted by the MODa program
ih<-invert(h)
# To find what +16Dalton maps to, we can do something like this:
values(ih, keys=c(16))
```
