====================================================

Files:

- `Curated_PTM_MassShifts.xlsx` -- Manually curated table that maps mass-shifts to the possible PTMs.

- `MassShift_ModificationType.csv` -- This table is directly copied from ABRF delt mass website, that lists mass-shifts to the possible modification type (More info here: https://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/dm.home?AvgMass=all)

- `samples.csv` -- Mapping of sample numbers to experimental time and replicate number
